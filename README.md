## Homework Assignment

1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can be a personal or school project.

Recently I got to head a labs project for Lambda School that really showed me where I was in related to my skills. Originally I started out not even having a group or a project to build. I was then assigned to ScannAR because they didn't have enough developers.

This was a pretty intimmedating project since it was actually being built for a real company!

I quickly became the guy everyone came to with question on how to do things like adding a feature or how to write a particular code. I Loved it. I learned a lot and also taught a lot of what I knew and learned in the process to my fellow devs. I built most of the front end, handled the client side Authentication, storing data from users like images ect. in the cloud, and also helped out with some queries on the backend.

Overall this was a very fun project and I am proud of how everything I've done in that 5-6 weeks.

2. Tell me a about a book, blog, article or GitHub repo you read or liked recently, and why you like it and why you should recommend I do the same.

I've been following Tj HolowayChuk alot lateley who seems to never quits, and is always contributing to what seems like everything. Forget all the time management books and productivity managemnet tools because you don't need them. Find someone who is doing "it" and copy what they do. Tj inspires me.

3. Describe what Availity does to a 7-year-old.

Well son, basically Availity is like magic! If I left my shoes outside they would bring it to me without me having to get up or asking you to get it.

Thats what they do with the information we tell the doctors when we visit.
